Implementation of a collaborative filtering algorithm in Python that uses stochastic gradient decent to optimize a linear loss function of movie and user attributes, along with L2 regularization. This implementation was created as part of an assignment for UC Berkeley's CS281B Scalable Machine Learning course. I offer no guarentees on the performance or robustness of the implementation, but it may serve as a useful reference implementation for someone in the future.

Data: This uses the MovieLens Dataset as input. You can read about the format of the input data [here](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-10m-README.html) and then download the specific zip files containing the data [here](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) (specifically, this code used the [10M dataset](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-10m.zip))
